# chronometre
I have programmed a simple Chronomètre as part of my first programming project. Chronomètre is an application that displays and tracks time accurately.

Chronomètre is designed with a user-friendly interface where users can start, stop, and reset the timer. The time is displayed in the format of hours:minutes:seconds and is updated periodically.

I have used programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in developing Chronomètre. HTML provides the structure of the application and the necessary elements for displaying time. CSS is used to style the application and make it visually appealing. JavaScript manages the backend logic for calculating and updating the time based on user actions.

I am proud of this project and look forward to sharing it on GitHub. If you need any assistance in uploading it or any additional information, feel free to ask.
